The goal of this project was to create a social-media app and have it be fully deployed with real-time updates.

Following my first project, the eCommerce website, I went by designing this website from the mobile-first approach.

Functionality that I wished to include:
- User authentication.
- Ability to create posts.
- Have personal settings to change the website theme.
- Have the option to change your account settings including username, avatars and post banner.
- Have a profile page for each user which will also display their image posts.
- Be able to follow and unfollow users.
- A page to display the users you are following or are following you.
- One on one chat messaging system.
- A search bar that can search through the signed up users.
- Ability to comment on posts
- Ability to like each post

Improvements that can be made:
- The "show more comments" function will show more comments but does not track if you have reached all of the comments.
- The chat system works but I had to use a timeout function to get past an error that sometimes occurs whenever a chat is newly created.

This website was designed heavily using material-ui but I also used a fair amount of css/scss. This website is now fully responsive too all screen sizes, material-ui helped to achieve this with their grid methods.

This project was fully deployed using firebase, the backend database was also stored using firebase,
